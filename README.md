# ConsumerAPI
Rest service made up with js, to create an API for a restaurant. This allows to see a front that can calculates different dishes and cost of each one for the specific consumer or table.

# Components
This API consist of different componets. The js (executes the bussines logic), the apiObjects.json (Which is the
document that contains the object that will be used for the api) and the index and bootstrap bundle.
Of course you can change the api objects to adapt it to your objects that you desire to have in your bussines.

# Functionality
If you want to deploy the API to consume it, you have to execute the following command.


```
cd ConsumerAPI
```

```
json-server --watch <json file used as server> --port 4000
```

After that, you have the server going on with the objects ready to be used.
If you deploy de front after that for example with live server, you will be able to test the response of the 
program.
